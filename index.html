    <h1>Rikers Debate Project</h1>
    
    <p>Debate teaches communication, conflict resolution, and public citizenship. Our program helps our students <strong>advocate for their political interests, resolve conflicts peacefully and productively, and empathize with outside perspectives.</strong> Debate means subjecting ideas to discussion, disagreement, criticism, and improvement.</p>
    
    <h2>Rikers Students &mdash; the Classroom Experience</h2>

    <p><strong>This initiative helps inmates:</strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li>Publicly advocate for their opinions and interests in a manner that is respectful, assertive, and productive.</li>

      <li>Build skills to resolve conflicts through discussion and negotiation.</li>

      <li>Occupy their time in an interesting and enjoyable way.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Beyond the Island &mdash; Lifetime Benefits to Rikers Participants</h2>

    <p>A criminal record makes it hard to find a job. Communication skills are invaluable to overcoming this challenge. Our program will:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Make participants more confident, analytical, and articulate in job interviews.</li>

      <li>Teach creative, analytical, and conceptual thinking through discussion of complex issues.</li>

      <li>Instill a competitive and achievement-oriented mentality.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Our Debate Unionâ€™s Values</h2>

    <p>Our program is new and ambitious. Because we have true faith in the power of rational discourse to improve the world, we also have great expectations for what bringing debate to the criminal justice field can accomplish. We hope that by building skills of self-advocacy and a culture of public debate in the criminal justice field, we can both improve the procedure by which our society considers these issues and expand the set of voices that have a say in policy. We set high standards for ourselves and for our students. To meet them, we are constantly self-criticizing, evaluating and improving. We judge our work on the impact we have on our students and on the criminal justice field.</p>
