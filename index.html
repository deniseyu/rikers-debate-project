      <h2>Who We Are</h2>

      <p>We are a group of former college debaters and current professionals dedicated to teaching students at Rikers Island the skill of competitive debate.</p>

      <p>Debate teaches communication, conflict resolution, and public citizenship. Our program helps our students advocate for their political interests, resolve conflicts peacefully and productively, and empathize with outside perspectives. Debate means subjecting ideas to discussion, disagreement, criticism, and improvement.</p>

      <p>This initiative helps inmates:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Publicly advocate for their opinions and interests in a manner that is respectful, assertive, and productive.</li>

        <li>Build skills to resolve conflicts through discussion and negotiation.</li>

        <li>Occupy their time in an interesting and enjoyable way.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>A criminal record makes it hard to find a job. Communication skills are invaluable to overcoming this challenge. Our program will:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Make participants more confident, analytical, and articulate in job interviews.</li>

        <li>Teach creative, analytical, and conceptual thinking through discussion of complex issues.</li>

        <li>Instill a competitive and achievement-oriented mentality.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Our program is new and ambitious. Because we have true faith in the power of rational discourse to improve the world, we also have great expectations for what bringing debate to the criminal justice field can accomplish. We hope that by building skills of self-advocacy and a culture of public debate in the criminal justice field, we can both improve the procedure by which our society considers these issues and expand the set of voices that have a say in policy. We set high standards for ourselves and for our students. To meet them, we are constantly self-criticizing, evaluating and improving. We judge our work on the impact we have on our students and on the criminal justice field.</p>

      <h2>Where We Teach on Rikers Island</h2>

      <p><strong>George R. Vierno Center (GRVC):</strong> The facility where the Project was founded, GRVC opened in 1991 and today can house 1,330 adolescent to adult male inmates. Classes started at GRVC in early July, 2016.</p>

      <p><strong>Rose M. Singer Center (RMSC):</strong> RMSC is the only jail on the island that houses female inmates, and it has a current capacity of 2,017. Inmates are usually housed here for short terms while they await trial or to serve out a jail sentence of less than one year.</p>

      <p><strong>Eric. M. Taylor Center (EMTC):</strong> EMTC houses adolescent and adult male inmates sentenced to terms of one year or less. Unlike the other jails on the island, EMTC is unique in that incarcerated individuals have been convicted, rather than just being detained.</p>
