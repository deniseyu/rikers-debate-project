To kick off the New Year the topics chosen for debate bent towards the more abstract. Topics
such as “Does God Exist?” and “Which Superpower is the Best?” were explored, challenging students
and volunteers alike! Argument structure and refuting the opponent’s points were pushed as deciding
factors when judging a debate. The students took these concepts to heart, incorporating numbering
points and clash into their rounds.

The students continue to impress as they find ways to suss out the subtleties in arguments made during
class. The use of Occam’s razor for **both** the government and the opposition during the “Does God
Exist?” debate illustrates just how creative the students can be!
