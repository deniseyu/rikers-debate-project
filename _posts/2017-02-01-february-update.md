During this month the executive orders enacted via the new administration were put under a
microscope by the students. Specifically, the debate on immigration provided the class with a lot to
think about. Considering the leaps and bounds by which students have improved their skills, a public
debate between GRVC and RMSC will be proposed sometime in the near future.

With the success of the GRVC and RMSC programs, the DOC has been broached with expanding the class
to the Eric M. Taylor Center (EMTC). A 14 week module is being drafted, and will allow for easier
implementation of new programs.
