In the past six months, the Rikers Debate Project has grown to a devoted community of nearly fifty members, with more than a dozen volunteers and several dozen students in classes at two different correctional facilities. By teaching political expression and critical thinking to a community our society has largely left behind, we have clearly managed to capture something important and vital.

We, is hosting a party last Friday to celebrate our new debate class for female inmates at the Rose M Singer Center (RMSC) and also to make new connections with other organizations working in the fields of criminal justice reform and reentry.
