      <p>The Rikers Debate Project believes everyone should have the right to vote, including prisoners. Currently, tens of thousands of New Yorkers are currently disenfranchised, losing their vital voice in our society. In order to better rehabilitate and empower our students, we will be working with legislators and community organizations to allow our students and all of the incarcerated to vote once again. For more information on this voting rights initiative, please contact us.</p>
